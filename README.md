### Hi there 

Hi, I'm Magdalena (she/her). I am a people-oriented Software Engineer with a background in Public Policy and International Development.
When I'm not stuck at home during quarantine you can find me eating my way through San Francisco, playing with and instagramming my two cats, and, of course, coding.
